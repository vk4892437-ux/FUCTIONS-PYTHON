        " Method: A method, on the other hand, is a function that is defined inside a class and is tied to an instance of that class. Methods typically operate on the instance's attributes (data) and can modify the state of the object. When you call a method, you do so on an instance of the class, and the method has access to the instance's attributes through the self parameter.\n",

        ". Improved Performance: Generators can improve performance by avoiding the need to create and store large data structures in memory.\n",
        ". Flexibility: Generators can be used to implement cooperative multitasking, where tasks yield control to other tasks voluntarily.\n",
